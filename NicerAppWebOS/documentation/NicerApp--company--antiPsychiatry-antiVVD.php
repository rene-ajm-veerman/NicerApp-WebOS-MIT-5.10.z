        Personal history : I was severly mistreated by psychiatry at mentrum.nl, and later at arkin.nl as well, really by all psychiatrists that I've ever encountered, in the form of :</p>

        <ol class="backdropped naComments_onTheSide" style="background:rgba(0,0,0,0.4);padding:10px;margin:10px;border-radius:10px;">
            <li><b>Haldol treatments which caused suicidal thoughts</b>, a treatment which is no doubt suited for psychopathically violent individuals above my weightclass and height</b>, but not for someone like me who has never broken the law (except for a few fine-able offenses).</li>
            <li>The near-complete draining of my savings account as I needed to save my own life from these suicidal thoughts, even after quitting the Haldol -against "doctor's" advice- by embarking on a long trip to Australia.</li>
            <li>Epilepsy.</li>
            <li>Tremors.</li>
            <li>Cramps.</li>
            <li>Moderate obesity.</li>
            <li><img src="https://nicer.app/NicerAppWebOS/documentation/selfies/rene-ajm-veerman/Dilan -VVD.NL- on self-sufficiency while the VVDs WVGGZ law prescribed me protective custody.jpeg"/><br/>While the party I voted for in the last elections (vvd.nl) has taken on a new goal now in Feb 2026 (self-sufficiency for the populace), <b/>I like so many other psychiatric victims have been held down by very draconian 'protective custody' contracts, that get stuck to a patient by their own parents, who are in turn panicked into a quick signing procedure by a shrink. I suspect this to be standard practice.</b></li>
            <li>Constant false accusations, transgressing the slander and libel laws (smaad, laster en zwartmakerij) by my 2 latest shrinks. Sheer false rumors exaggerated and then portrayed as truths about me, to judges, who willingly ignore the constitution and all basic ancient medical law (do no harm to a patient), just to keep me in treatment for probably the rest of my life.</li>
            <li>Legal representation that is at every desk a false hope, and/or an outright (bunch of) traitor(s) to my interests.</li>
        </ol>

        <p class="backdropped naComments_onTheSide">And still, <b>the root cause of my need to visit psychiatric care at all, my stubborn day-night-rythm irregularity problem -which can and has led to confused speech-, wasn't properly addressed by mentrum until about 15 years into my treatment</b>, based on advice that <b>I</b> gave them in a hospital of theirs in Amsterdam North (Boven het IJ ziekenhuis); to not allow caffeinated coffee served during the afternoon and evening.<br/>
        Following this advice at home has not been easy, but I suspect it's the only advice I'll ever need from these shrink monsters at mentrum.nl

        <h2>Political views</h2>
        <p class="backdropped naComments_onTheSide" style="background:rgba(0,255,255,0.4) !important;">
        I admit my political views are tainted by my time in psychiatry and analyzing mass media news output, which does seem to clearly indicate there is a class-justice system in play in the western world, which I sometimes find disheartening, frustrating and a valid reason for verbal anger.<br/>
        </p>

        <p class="backdropped naComments_onTheSide">
        But the road ahead seems clear; use that same class justice system and existing elites' bureaucracies, along with persistent and smart but also strictly peaceful forms of demonstrations, to <b>install online-referendums-about-everything style governments</b> in most or all western countries, and possibly some tag-along countries as well.<br/>
        </p>

        <p class="backdropped naComments_onTheSide">
        It is my firm belief that humanity should not allow itself to be ever again goaded into conventional war after conventional war by the ruling classes.
